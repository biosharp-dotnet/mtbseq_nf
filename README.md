# Mtbseq-nf

**NOTE**: This still a work in progress, the code is functional however the usage doc needs some love!

Project with aim to create a nextflow wrapper for mtbseq workflow.

Heavily based on [ngs-fzb/MTBseq_source](https://github.com/ngs-fzb/MTBseq_source)

# Benefits of the Nextflow wrapper

- Reliance of bioconda for installing packages
- Reproducibility via containers 
- Deployability on a range of infratructure (cloud/on-prem clusters/local machine)
