# Mtbseq-nf

**NOTE: This still a work in progress, the code is functional however the [usage](#Usage) doc needs some love!**

[MTBseq](https://github.com/ngs-fzb/MTBseq_source) made simple and easy using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow manager. 

# Benefits of the Nextflow wrapper

- Reliance of bioconda for installing packages
- Reproducibility via containers 
- Ease of use on a range of infrastructure (cloud/on-prem clusters/local machine)
- Resumability for failed processes
- Centralized location for specifying 
    - Hardware requirements 
    - Software requirements ( MTBseq version )
    - MTBseq parameters
- Dedicated user interface for all parameters (for wider audience)

# Usage 

## Nextflow command line


## Nextflow Tower
